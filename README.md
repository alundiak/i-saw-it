# i-saw-it
plugin for marking already seen resources

## Use case
You have many friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and they share lot of information. You follow many news services, which re-publish materials, you've might have seen before. Sometimes, people tend to re-post, re-share old memories, or old resources. So how about to skip that for you, and mark it as already seen? What if you saw the information and want to save your time?

## Idea
Plug-in, add-on to Chrome, Firefox or mobile application, which will check all your web surfing, and with your ranted access to follow you elsewhere. Application should be heavily based on #AI, #ML and remember content you saw. Remember not only URL, and headings, but the real meaning of content. So that AI could decide, and hide it from your attention.

## Implementation
If it's mobile app, then better to wrap it using #ReactNative and the heart of algorithm should be MachineLearning. There should be a model of resources. It might be specifically Facebook media, or external resources, anyway need to parse and conent and return `true` if the content has been seen, read, followed, etc.

## Maybe
Python? Bot API? Tensorflow?
